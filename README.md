# sPDF #

sPDF ( pronunced _speedy-f_ ) is a Scala library that makes it super easy to create complex PDFs from plain old HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

On the backend it uses [wkhtmltopdf](http://github.com/antialize/wkhtmltopdf) which renders HTML using Webkit.

__sPDF__ is heavily inspired by Ruby's [PdfKit](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit) gem.

The main features of __sPDF__ are:

* full support of `wkhtmltopdf` extended parameters (see the source of the `PdfConfig` trait)
* can read HTML from several sources: `java.io.File`, `java.io.InputStream`, `java.net.URL`, `scala.xml.Elem`, and `String`
* can write PDFs to `File` and `OutputStream`

Th source HTML can reference to images and stylesheet files as long as the URLs point to the absolute path of the source file.
It's also possible to embed javascript code in the pages, `wkhtmltopdf` will wait for the document ready event before generating the PDF.

## Installation ##

Add the following to your sbt build (for Scala 2.9.1, Scala 2.9.2, Scala 2.9.3, and Scala 2.10.x!):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.cloudify" %% "spdf" % "1.0.0"
```

## Usage ##

```scala
	import io.github.cloudify.scala.spdf._
	import java.io._
	import java.net._

	// Create a new Pdf converter with a custom configuration
	// run `wkhtmltopdf --extended-help` for a full list of options
	val pdf = Pdf(new PdfConfig {
	  orientation := Landscape
	  pageSize := "Letter"
	  marginTop := "1in"
	  marginBottom := "1in"
	  marginLeft := "1in"
	  marginRight := "1in"
	})

	val page = <html><body><h1>Hello World</h1></body></html>

	// Save the PDF generated from the above HTML into a Byte Array
	val outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream
	pdf.run(page, outputStream)

	// Save the PDF of Google's homepage into a file
	pdf.run(new URL("http://www.google.com"), new File("google.pdf"))
```

## Installing wkhtmltopdf ##

Visit the [wkhtmltopdf homepage](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/).

### Linux

Download the static binary for your architecture at the [wkhtmltopdf downloads list](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/list), extract the file to a directory that is in your `PATH`, such as `/opt` or `/usr/local/bin` and run from there.

#### Debian / Ubuntu ####

```sh
	apt-get install wkhtmltopdf
```

### Windows

Download the installer from the [wkhtmltopdf downloads list](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/list) and tell `Pdf` where it is.

### Mac

Download the disk image from [wkhtmltopdf downloads list](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/list) and copy the file to a directory in your `PATH`.

Otherwise, if you have __homebrew__, run:

```sh
brew install wkhtmltopdf
```

## Troubleshooting ##

### NoExecutableException ###

Make sure `wkhtmltopdf` is installed and your JVM is running with the correct `PATH` environment variable.

If that doesn't work you can manually set the path to `wkhtmltopdf` when you create a new `Pdf` instance:

```scala

val pdf = Pdf("/opt/bin/wkhtmltopdf", PdfConfig.default)

```

### Resources aren't included in the PDF ###

Images, CSS, or JavaScript does not seem to be downloading correctly in the PDF. This is due to the fact that `wkhtmltopdf` does not know where to find those files. Make sure you are using absolute paths (start with forward slash) to your resources. If you are using PDFKit to generate PDFs from a raw HTML source make sure you use complete paths (either file paths or urls including the domain).

## Notes ##

### Asynchronous conversion ###

__sPDF__ relyies on Scala's `scala.sys.process.Process` class to execute `wkhtmltopdf` and pipe input/output data.

The execution of `wkhtmltopdf` and thus the conversion to PDF is blocking. If you need the processing to be asynchronous you can wrap the call inside a `Future`.

```scala

val pdf = Pdf(PdfConfig.default)

val result = Future { pdf.run(new URL("http://www.google.com"), new File("google.pdf")) }

```

## Contributing ##

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with build settings, version, or history.
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

## Roadmap ##

- [X] Full support for extended options
- [X] Full support for input types
- [ ] Streaming API (with `scalaz-stream`)
- [Â ] Simplified API with implicits
- [ ] Integration with Play for streaming PDFs in HTTP responses
